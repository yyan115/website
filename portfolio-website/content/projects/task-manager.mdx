# Task Management App

A modern task management application built with React and Firebase. This app helps users organize their tasks, set deadlines, and track progress on different projects.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login with email or Google
- **Task Creation**: Create, edit, and delete tasks
- **Project Organization**: Group tasks by projects
- **Deadline Reminders**: Get notifications for upcoming deadlines
- **Progress Tracking**: Track completion status and history
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on mobile and desktop

## Development Process

I built this application using React for the frontend and Firebase for the backend services. Firebase Auth handles user authentication, Firestore manages the database, and Firebase Hosting deploys the application.

For the UI, I used Tailwind CSS to create a clean and intuitive interface that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Challenges and Solutions

One challenge was implementing real-time updates for tasks. I solved this by using Firestore's real-time listeners, which automatically update the UI when data changes.

Another challenge was managing complex state across the application. I implemented a custom hook system to abstract Firebase logic and make components more maintainable.

```javascript
// Example of a custom hook for Firebase integration
function useFirestore(collection) {
  const [docs, setDocs] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const unsubscribe = db.collection(collection)
      .orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')
      .onSnapshot((snapshot) => {
        const documents = snapshot.docs.map(doc => ({
          id: doc.id,
          ...doc.data()
        }));
        setDocs(documents);
        setLoading(false);
      });
    
    return () => unsubscribe();
  }, [collection]);

  return { docs, loading };
}
```

## Conclusion

This project helped me gain experience with Firebase and real-time database operations. It also improved my skills in building intuitive user interfaces and managing application state effectively.
