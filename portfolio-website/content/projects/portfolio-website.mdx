# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. It features a responsive design, dark mode, and content management with MDX and Contentlayer.

## Features

- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on all devices
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes
- **Content Management**: Easy to update with MDX and Contentlayer
- **Performance Optimized**: Fast loading times and optimized images
- **SEO Friendly**: Proper metadata and structured data

## Development Process

I started by planning the structure and design of the website. I wanted a clean, minimalist design that would showcase my projects and skills effectively. I chose Next.js for its excellent performance and developer experience.

For styling, I used Tailwind CSS with the shadcn/ui component library. This allowed me to create a consistent design system while maintaining flexibility.

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the challenges I faced was implementing the dark mode toggle. I solved this by using the next-themes library, which provides a simple way to manage themes in Next.js applications.

Another challenge was creating a content management system that would allow me to easily update my projects and blog posts. I solved this by using Contentlayer, which transforms my MDX files into type-safe content objects.

```typescript
// Example of a component from the project
function ProjectCard({ project }) {
  return (
    <div className="rounded-lg overflow-hidden shadow-lg">
      <img src={project.image} alt={project.title} className="w-full" />
      <div className="p-6">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">{project.title}</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700">{project.description}</p>
        <div className="mt-4 flex gap-2">
          {project.tags.map((tag) => (
            <span key={tag} className="bg-gray-200 px-2 py-1 rounded text-sm">
              {tag}
            </span>
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Building this portfolio was a great learning experience. I was able to practice my skills in React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS while creating a platform to showcase my work.
