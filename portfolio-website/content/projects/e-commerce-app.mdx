# E-Commerce Application

This is a full-stack e-commerce application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It features user authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, and payment processing.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign up, login, and profile management
- **Product Catalog**: Browse products by categories
- **Shopping Cart**: Add, remove, and update items
- **Payment Processing**: Secure checkout with Stripe
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage products, orders, and users
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices

## Development Process

I started by designing the database schema and setting up the backend API with Express and MongoDB. I implemented authentication using JWT and created RESTful endpoints for managing products, users, and orders.

For the frontend, I used React with Redux for state management. I implemented the shopping cart functionality and integrated Stripe for payment processing.

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the challenges I faced was implementing the shopping cart functionality. I solved this by using Redux to manage the cart state across the application.

Another challenge was handling the file uploads for product images. I solved this by using Cloudinary for image storage and retrieval.

```javascript
// Example of a Redux action from the project
export const addToCart = (id, quantity) => async (dispatch, getState) => {
  try {
    const { data } = await axios.get(`/api/products/${id}`);

    dispatch({
      type: 'ADD_TO_CART',
      payload: {
        product: data._id,
        name: data.name,
        price: data.price,
        image: data.image,
        quantity,
      },
    });

    localStorage.setItem('cartItems', JSON.stringify(getState().cart.cartItems));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};
```

## Conclusion

Building this e-commerce application was a challenging but rewarding experience. I was able to practice my full-stack development skills and create a complete e-commerce solution from scratch.
